## About

I've been working as mechanical product designer on commercial CAD systems for more the 30 years. I've been a hobbiest programmer since I got a commodore 64 for christmas in eighth grade. Im use my knowledge from both fields to create some tools that work the way I believe they should and allow me to work the way I work.

## Helpful Information

One of my first projects is simply to document how I do things. Others who also have a passion for computer software development may find this information helpful.
