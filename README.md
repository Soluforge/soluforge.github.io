## About

I've been working as mechanical product designer on commercial CAD systems for more the 30 years. I've been a hobbiest programmer since I got a commodore 64 for christmas in eighth grade.

## Helpful Information

One of my first projects is to document how I do things. Others who also have a passion for software development may find this information helpful.
